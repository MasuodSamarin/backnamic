# backnamic

# this script was made to change the normal,boring, static background of gnome desktops into a cool, dynamic background. 
it's really simple to use too:
1) run the following command from a terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pouya-abbasian/backnamic.git && mv backnamic ~/backnamic ; cd backnamic ; chmod +x script.sh
```
2) use the following command to start the script:
```bash
~/backnamic/./script.sh &
```
done!
enjoy your new dynamic background!
